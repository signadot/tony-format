## Current work focus

### Streaming Patch Processor (#13)
The main pending work. Three-piece design:

1. **Patch Simplification** (write-time, not implemented)
   - Convert complex mergeops to simple ops before storage
   - Location: `tx/simplify.go` (planned)

2. **Streaming Patch Application** (read-time, partial)
   - Current: `InMemoryApplier` materializes full doc (temporary)
   - Target: Streaming processor with no container buffering
   - Design doc: `docs/streaming_patch_processor.md`

3. **Compaction Patch Writing** (write-time, not implemented)
   - Write patches instead of full snapshots during compaction

### Recently completed
- git-issue tool with all basic commands
- Labels for issues
- Export/import commands with binary file support
- Editor integration for comments

### Constraints for streaming
- Memory efficient - horizontal streaming within containers
- Out-of-memory patterns for large documents
- Event-based snapshots (completed)
