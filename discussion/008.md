## TonyAPI Vision (attached: tonyapi/)

TonyAPI presents access to "1 giant Tony document" as a computed view.

### Core Concept
Operations use Tony documents tagged with `!apiop`:
- `path:` - where to operate
- `match:` - conditions
- `patch:` - mutations (optional)

### Key Documentation (attached)
- `index.md` - Overview and navigation
- `design.md` - Architecture and philosophy (**start here**)
- `queries.md` - Query structure, field selection, `!let` joins
- `controllers.md` - Mount points, lifecycle, diff-based communication
- `logd-server-design.md` - Diff-based backend, transaction support

### Why It Matters
This is the API layer that makes tony-format useful for real applications.
The streaming patch processor (#13) is foundational infrastructure for this.
