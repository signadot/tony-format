Correction: With `-I y` (YAML input mode), extra-indented arrays and non-standard YAML indentation work fine. The gotcha is only about format auto-detection - when piping without `-I y`, Tony's stricter parser is used.

Workflow: `cat file.yaml | o view -I y` or `o view -I y file.yaml` for full YAML compatibility.
