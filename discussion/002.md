## Open Questions
1. Initial state: full snapshot or assume client has it?

Let's start with initial state, then consider adding an option for diff-only since a commit.

2. Reconnection: client provides last-seen commit, server resumes from there?

see above.

3. Path granularity: watch `users` vs `users[*]` vs `users.*.status`?

no constraints, path can be anything

4. Filtering: watch only changes matching a pattern?

interesting, open an issue perhaps?  not for initial implementation.
