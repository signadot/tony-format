## Proposed solution: Reversed XIDs

XIDs (12 bytes / 20 chars) provide globally unique, time-ordered identifiers without coordination:
- 4 bytes: timestamp (second precision)
- 3 bytes: machine ID
- 2 bytes: process ID
- 3 bytes: counter (random start)

**Key insight: present XIDs byte-reversed to users.**

With normal XIDs, the timestamp prefix means issues created around the same time share prefixes:
```
cq3n8v9g010004s0a8ng  (issue A, today)
cq3n8v9g020005t1b9oh  (issue B, today)
cq3n8v9g030006u2c0pi  (issue C, today)
```
You'd need many characters to disambiguate.

With reversed XIDs, the counter/machine/pid bits come first:
```
gn8a0s400010g9v8n3qc  (issue A)
ho9b1t500020g9v8n3qc  (issue B)
ip0c2u600030g9v8n3qc  (issue C)
```
Now `gn8`, `ho9`, `ip0` are already unique - short prefixes work like git short SHAs.

**Benefits:**
- Conflict-free distributed usage (XIDs are globally unique)
- Short prefix references work naturally (`git issue show gn8`)
- Still sortable (reverse for chronological order)
- Clock skew only affects ordering, not uniqueness
- Simpler than maintaining local number mappings

**Optional enhancement:** Could also show local numbers in listings for extra convenience, recomputed after `git issue pull --all`.
