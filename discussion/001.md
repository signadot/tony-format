The docs/ folder has comprehensive technical specs (tony.md, ir.md, etc.) but lacks user-facing documentation for adoption.

Needed for success as a Helm/Kustomize alternative:
- Getting started guide: installation, first commands with 'o' CLI
- Common workflows: how to do what Kustomize does with Tony
- Examples with real-world use cases (k8s manifests, config overlays)
- Migration path from existing tools

Without this, the barrier to adoption is too high even if the core is solid.
