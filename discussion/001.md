Tony tools work well alongside JSON/YAML and can be used in existing environments. Documentation should cover:

**What works seamlessly:**
- JSON input/output: `o view -O json` and JSON input parsing
- Kubernetes-style YAML: arrays with `- ` at same indent level as key
- Multi-document files (without leading `---`)
- kubectl, kustomize, helm output parses correctly
- Round-trip preserves comments

**Safety improvements over YAML:**
- `no`, `yes`, `on`, `off` stay as strings (no Norway problem)
- No implicit type coercion for unquoted values
- Stricter parsing catches errors YAML would silently accept

**Gotchas to document:**
- Arrays with extra indentation fail (use k8s-style indent)
- Leading `---` not supported (start with content)
- YAML anchors/aliases (`&anchor`, `*alias`) not supported
- Some YAML idioms may need adjustment

**Workflow examples:**
- Pipe kubectl output through Tony for diff/patch
- Convert JSON configs to Tony for editing
- Use Tony patches on YAML files, output as YAML
