Tracking issue for the kpath migration proposal in system/logd/storage/docs/kpath_migration_proposal.md

Key phases:
- Phase 1: Move kindedpath code into ir package, implement ParseKPath, KPath.String, etc.
- Phase 2: Remove JSONPath from TokenSource/TokenSink, use kpaths only  
- Phase 3: Update Index to use KindedPath (partially done)
- Phase 4: Update streaming indexer and incremental parsing
- Phase 5: Cleanup, documentation, and testing

This is foundational for !key(path) support and clean storage layer.
