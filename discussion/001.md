## Session coordination for scott's Claude

### On session start
- Check `git issue list --label agent` for coordination issues
- Check `git issue list` for open work
- If resuming work, look for recent comments showing what was in progress

### Work isolation
- For significant work, use a git worktree to avoid conflicts with scott's parallel work
- Create worktree: `git worktree add ../.worktrees/issue-NNN -b issue-NNN`
- Work there, merge via git when done

### Claiming work
- Before starting on an issue, add a comment describing what you're working on
- This helps coordinate if scott has multiple Claude sessions or context resets

### Project focus
- Main focus: tony-format (the data format itself)
- logd storage is one application of tony-format
- Key pending work: Streaming Patch Processor (#13)
