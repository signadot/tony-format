## Simplified approach

Since dlog uses only 2 log files (A/B rotation), and `*os.File.ReadAt` uses `pread` (thread-safe, no file pointer movement), the fix is simple:

```go
type DLog struct {
    fileA *os.File  // kept open, used via ReadAt
    fileB *os.File  // kept open, used via ReadAt
}
```

- Open both files at DLog startup
- All reads use `ReadAt(p, offset)` - no seeking, concurrent-safe
- Close both at shutdown

No pool, no config, no eviction. Let usage-demonstrated seek contention drive anything more complicated.
