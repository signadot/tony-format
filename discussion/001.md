For developers who want to use tony-format as a Go library (not just CLI), the entry points aren't immediately obvious.

Useful examples would show:
- Parse Tony/YAML/JSON into ir.Node
- Compute diff between two ir.Nodes
- Apply patch to a document
- Match documents against a pattern
- Round-trip with comment preservation
- Use !key(name) for keyed array merging

These would complement docs/tony.md and docs/ir.md by showing the Go API in action, making it easier to integrate tony-format into other tools.
