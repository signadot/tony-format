motivation.md positions Tony as a better alternative to Helm and Kustomize. To prove this claim, we need concrete examples showing:

1. Base + overlay pattern (like Kustomize) but with Tony patches
2. Generating Helm charts from Tony (the -x encoding option)
3. Strategic merge patches with !key(name) for lists
4. Diff → patch round-trip for real k8s manifests
5. Comment preservation through transformations

These examples would:
- Validate the claims in motivation.md
- Serve as adoption proof points
- Be usable as documentation/tutorials

Related to #47 (user documentation).
