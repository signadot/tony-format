# comments in diffs, patches, and matches

This issue tracks the design and implementation of comments in diffs, patches, and
matches.

Head comments vs line comments

diffs: how to report diffs in comments?
matches: how to require a comment in a match?  !comment and then a string match?
patches: need to break down the 4 cases of source and patch having comments and not and map them
to patch options.
