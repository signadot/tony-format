# Tony Format

A data format where patches, queries, and schemas are expressed as documents themselves — combining JSON's structure with YAML's readability while preserving comments and metadata.

- [Docs](docs/index.md)
- [Go](go-tony/README.md)

## Status

The core Tony format is fairly stable and fun.  One CLI tool with several
basic commands, [`o`](go-tony/README.md), is in use and fairly stable.  This repository is booting.

Several items are in the works, ranging from under design to bleeding edge,
buggy prototypes.

- Schema
- Mappings to Go
- Go CodeGen
- System API
- Docs Website
- LSP

## Contributing

The Tony format is open source.

As a naisant, enhanced data format for an interconnected and increasingly automated world,
a lot of possibilities, some substantial, exist.

Feel free to reach out on the Issues or Discussions, give the tools a try, weigh in on
the direction of designs, or let us know how you'd like to see the format and tooling
governed.
